## Video Based Vehicle Detection and Tracking Using Image Processing and Deep Learning Using Customised Dataset (Final Academic Thesis 2021,yet to be published in gernal )
**Abstract:**  
In today’s world, the intelligent transportation system plays a crucial role in the field of traffic management to provide an efficient and reliable transportation system. One of the applications of the intelligent transportation system is to detect and track vehicles accurately. Smart detection and tracking systems require the collection of processed data from respective procedures for the regulation of classifying. In this regard, surveillance cameras have been installed in monitoring and control of traffic in the last few years. Image processing algorithms have been widely developed to monitor the motion of vehicles, humans, or any other objects. Video processing of traffic data obtained through prerecorded video is an instance of applications for advanced cautioning or data extraction for real-time analysis of vehicles. However, the traditional vehicle systems may be declined and not recognized well due to the vehicles being occluded by other vehicles or by background obstacles such as road signals, trees, weather conditions and the performance of these systems depend on a good traffic image analysis approaches to detect, track and classify the vehicles. Here we have studied and analyzed previous works done on this area, identified the research scope, understand the process, methods used, and finally, propose a model that might help us in vehicle detection and tracking with great accuracy.

## Local Vehicle Detection using machine learning - Hog + SVM (Project based research 2021)
**Abstract:** 
Vehicle detection is a very essential application for driver assistance system and autonomous self guided vehicles . In Bangladesh, there are various kinds of local vehicles like- rickshaw, CNG, leguna which we can see everyday on the road .For this project, a new high definition local vehicle dataset, containing 25,000 images is made on perspective of Bangladesh .This research work propose a video based vehicle detection. Experimental results using video collected from real world scenarios are provided,
showing that the proposed method possesses accuracy and it can detect vehicle targets successfully in real life environment. The focus of the paper is to solve the problem
of feature extraction and classification for detecting local vehicles . Thus, we propose using Histogram of Oriented Gradient(HOG) for feature extraction and Support Vector
Machine(SVMs) for vehicle detection .The goal of this study is to identify the local vehicles individually and find the accuracy. We have also discussed general challenges and
future work scopes and plans.

## Development Of A Graphical User Interface (gui) For Rainwater Harvesting System” 5th International Conference on Civil Engineering for Sustainable Development: ICCESD 2020 Khulna, Bangladesh ( 5th International Conference Civil Engineering for Sustainable Development: iccesd 2020 Khulna, Bangladesh )
**Abstract:**
ainwater harvesting (RWH) system has a good potential to supply drinking and cooking water inwater-scarce coastal areas in Bangladesh. However, improper design of the storage reservoir, the keyelement of a RWH system, can result in a failure of the system. The size of a storage tank depends notonly on water demand but also on supply (precipitation amount and variability). Therefore, a dynamicreliability based tank sizing tool is imperative for the successful implementation of RWH. This paperaims at developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to ease sizing of storage tank of RWH system. Abehavioral model is applied in a MATLAB environment based on a dynamic demand-supplyapproach to calculate the reliability of the system associated with storage tank sizes. Both time andvolumetric reliability are incorporated in the model to provide with the number of days demand isfully met, and also the percent of total demand met by the system respectively. Precipitation data(1953 -2010) from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) is used as one of the inputs tothe model. In addition, household size, per capita water demand, roof area, roof material are importantparameters of the model. The model shows that a 15-m storage reservoir can provide 99% reliabilityfor a typical household having a roof area of 360 ft and a daily demand of 100 liters if precipitationvariability in Khulna, a coastal district, is considered. However, maximum 53% reliability can beachieved from the system for the same roof configuration if daily household demand doubles (200liters). Similar findings for two other adjacet districts (Mongla and Jessore) suggest that model resultscan be generalized to entire southwest coastal region in Bangladesh.
